I have calculated page reload time by using Lighthouse which is a chrome developer tool for calculating the performance of the website.

First Contentful Paint - 2.5s
Time to Interactive - 4.0s

For Improving my page reload time I have used React.lazy() and Suspense for lazy loading of the components which improved the interaction time by almost 1s
